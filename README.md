# Apollo Hospitalization Analysis Project

This project analyzes hospitalization data from Apollo hospitals to uncover insights into patient demographics, disease categories, and treatment patterns. The primary goal is to identify key trends, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize important metrics to support data-driven decision-making in the healthcare domain.
